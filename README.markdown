Ruby Password Generator
=======================

Ruby Password Generator aka RPG, is a password generator
written in ruby. It based on a simple principle: generators generate,
the master class uses generators to generate more easily.

There are two algorithm available right now: Korben and Marvin,

- Korben can generate random passwords of different size (by default 42
  characters long).
- Marvin can generate 42 characters long random passwords with no
  character repetition.

RPG comes with a command line tool and a Sinatra-based web application.

As any good ruby application, it is poorly documented because the code
is self-explanatory. The lack of documentation is indeed a shame.

Finally, the code is licensed under an MIT license available in the
license file.

So long, and thank you for the fish.
